A faster way for Indian non-profits to find and apply for their next grant

## Challenge

Non-profits are short on time, people, and – most critically – the funds required to make their missions a reality.
Grants can take time to find, and even more time to apply for, taking away from the time non-profits would rather spend supporting the needs of their communities.
Non-profits need a quick, easy way to find the most relevant grants and identify their eligibility, focusing their effort and time on the most likely grant opportunities.

## Solution

Our solution will provide a user experience for Indian non-profits applying for grants, ensuring they find suitable opportunities and receive support throughout the process. 
This application will streamline grant application by:
Suggesting grants where the non-profit is eligible
Helping to match the most appropriate funding sources for each unique non-profit’s mission
Answering questions about eligibility
Providing a single source of truth, enabling non-profits to upload/contribute their own knowledge
